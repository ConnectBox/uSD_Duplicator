This repo contains instructions for creating a uSD duplicator using an RPi-3 platform. 
This was originally described on the connectbox.technology website but the install script
referenced there was based on 2017 versions of the RPi platform. Since that time, the RPi OS
has added security features which prevent the duplicator install from working. This repo
describes changes to the install procedure which will allow the user to successfully install
the duplicator code.

For those desiring a prebuilt image, we have included one built on the July 04, 2024 RPi 
Bookworm image.
